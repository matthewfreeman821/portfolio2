                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Matthew Freeman and I am from Yorkville, GA, a small town nestled between Dallas and Rockmart. I spent 9 years in the United States Army where I was stationed at Fort Hood, TX, and Fort Benning, GA. While stationed at Fort Hood, I deployed to Baghdad in May of 2007 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 07-09. While stationed at Fort Benning, I became a certified Traffic Accident Investigator and provided security for high profile visitors.
                    After the military, I attended Reinhardt University where I earned a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics and Quantitative Sciences. I graduated with a 4.0 GPA, Summa Cum Laude, and a mention in Who's Who Among Students in American Universities & Colleges.
                    After graduating from Reinhardt University, I continued with traffic accident investigations by going to work for GEICO as an insurance adjuster. I left GEICO after realizing I would rather pursue something closer to my degree. I then took temporary jobs until I was introduced to DigitalCrafts.
                    DigitalCrafts showed me a way to utilize my degree and utilize technology to further my pursuit of knowledge and enter a career where I could challenge myself and build something which could help someone.
                    I currently live on Lake Lanier with my wife, 2 daughters, and 2 dogs. In my spare time, I enjoy reading and smoking food on my offset stick burning smoker.</p>
